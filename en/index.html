                        on Spring Batch without server access.</p>
                    <p>Improved the inefficient process where developers had to manually run Batch code and check logs
                        by accessing the server. Implemented CI/CD integration and job dependency management using

                    <h3>Transition from Batch to Stream for product price data's synchronization</h3>
                    <p>Improved the product price information DB synchronization process for dynamic pricing. The
                        previous method was to read data with batch after DB replication, processing 400GB of data.</p>
                    <p>Problem: Since the Batch method first truncates and then refills the price information, an error
                        occurs due to data blank when another dynamic pricing job is executed during synchronization. To
                        solve this problem, a strategy was introduced to stack data in a temporary table instead of
                        Truncate and then replace the table with <code>RENAME</code>.</p>
                    <p>Additional issue: As the number of products increased, the synchronization job time itself became
                        longer and the jobs overlapped. Finally, after initial loading with <code>mysqldump</code>, a
                        Kafka consuming app was developed to reflect only the changes in real time.</p>
                    <p>Achievement: Expanded the number of discounted products from 50 million to 280 million, and
                        achieved real-time price data. Enhanced stability by designing <code>Poison Pill</code>
                        processing logic and Row Lock prevention transactions.</p>

                    <h3>Renewal of main Batch of product price change system</h3>

                        Producer-Consumer pattern.</p>
                    <p>Shortened the process time from 1.5 hours to 10-20 minutes using branch processing and parallel
                        processing through Enum and Maps.</p>
                    <p>Achieved the number one lowest price share in Naver (as of December 2021) by catching up with the

                    <p>Problem: Seller status (grade/type/status) changes in multiple domains, making synchronization
